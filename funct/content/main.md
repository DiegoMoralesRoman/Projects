# Hello
I'm Diego Morales, student of the University of Alcal√° de Henares. This webpage contains all the projects i've done over the years, this being one of them.

If you haven't noticed, you can hover over the upper bar to display a list of important links to content on this page.

## Information about me
I've been coding since I was 13, starting with ```C++``` on Arduino. Since then I've been creating personal proyects to expand my knowledge about programming and computers in general. This information made it possible for me to join the UAH robotics team, where I've worked on real engineering proyects ever since.

### Programming languages I know
The following is a list of the programming languages and libraries/frameworks that I've used, ranked in order of familiarity:
- C++
- Python
- Java
- Web
  - HTML
  - SASS
  - Javascript
  - Typescript (basic knowledge)
  - Python flask
- Postgresql
